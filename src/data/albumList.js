    desc: `The Soul of Rock (English title: The Soul of Rock) is the debut studio album by Vietnamese rock band Tuong Tuong, released on February 3, 2002 by Hanoi Audiovisual Center. The album collects 10 of the most successful songs of the Wall, some of which have become 'gut songs' among students - the band's growth cradle. Although from the first demo recorded in June 1999 to the official recording, it took about a year because of lack of money to make. One year after the recording, after many knocks on the door of the outlets distributed throughout the North and the South, finally, "Soul of the Rock" was officially born. All production is actually done by the band members themselves.`,
